# Changelog: Maju Image Upload Fix - September 22, 2025

## Issue Summary
**Problem**: Images were not appearing in generated documents for the iTEKAD Maju program despite successful form submission. The issue was "images aren't appearing in generated documents" even though the form was submitting successfully.

**Root Cause**: Missing Folder_ID data due to field name mismatch between the mapping sheet structure and the API/form code.

## Technical Changes Made

### 1. Apps Script Deployment ‚úÖ
- **File**: `appsscript-2/Code.js`
- **Action**: Successfully deployed with `handleImageUpload` function
- **New Apps Script URL**: `AKfycbwKr1JFI5P8aPP_uktPC_NvGlc6Nln5AQkeLfDxZoGo8betsUKDNrz6_fYf9WDXiYVzpg`
- **Updated**: `.env.local` with new Apps Script URL for Maju program

### 2. Architecture Alignment ‚úÖ
- **File**: `pages/laporan-maju.js`
- **Action**: Converted to batch upload pattern matching the proven `laporan-sesi` workflow
- **Changes**:
  - Simplified `handleFileChange` to store files locally
  - Implemented batch `uploadImage` function
  - Updated `handleSubmit` to upload all images before form submission
  - Removed individual image upload on file selection

### 3. Upload Proxy Fixes ‚úÖ
- **File**: `pages/api/upload-proxy.js`
- **Action**: Fixed request cleaning to preserve `action` field
- **Issue**: Request body was being over-cleaned, removing the `action: 'uploadImage'` field needed by Apps Script
- **Fix**: Preserved essential fields while cleaning request body

### 4. **CRITICAL FIX**: Field Name Mapping ‚úÖ
- **Root Issue**: Field name mismatch between mapping sheet and code

#### 4.1 API Layer Fix
- **File**: `pages/api/laporanMajuData.js`
- **Problem**: API was looking for header `'fOLDER id'` (with space) but mapping sheet has `'Folder_ID'` (underscore, no space)
- **Fix**: 
  ```javascript
  // OLD (incorrect)
  const mapFolderIdIdx = mappingHeaders.indexOf(normHeader('fOLDER id'));
  
  // NEW (correct)
  const mapFolderIdIdx = mappingHeaders.indexOf(normHeader('Folder_ID'));
  ```
- **Response Field**: Changed from `Mentee_Folder_ID` to `Folder_ID` to match form expectations

#### 4.2 Form Layer Fix
- **File**: `pages/laporan-maju.js`
- **Problem**: Form was using `Mentee_Folder_ID` but API returns `Folder_ID`
- **Fix**: Updated all references:
  ```javascript
  // Form data structure
  Folder_ID: '',  // Changed from Mentee_Folder_ID: ''
  
  // Data assignment
  updatedFormData.Folder_ID = sessionData.menteeMapping.Folder_ID;
  
  // Usage in upload
  const folderId = formData.Folder_ID;
  ```

## Debugging Process

### 1. Initial Investigation
- Added extensive console logging to identify missing Folder_ID
- Discovered mentee selection was working but Folder_ID was empty
- Console showed business data present but critical Folder_ID missing

### 2. Data Structure Analysis
- Examined mapping sheet structure (attachment provided by user)
- Identified correct column names: `Folder_ID` in column I
- Cross-referenced with API response structure

### 3. Field Name Reconciliation
- Traced data flow from mapping sheet ‚Üí API ‚Üí form
- Found mismatch at API level: searching for wrong header name
- Found mismatch at form level: using different field name than API returns

## Testing Verification

### Before Fix
```
üìã Folder ID: 
üìã Mentee Name: Nisha Binti Junus
‚ùå Apps Script returned: Missing required fields: fileData, fileName, or folderId
```

### After Fix
```
üìã Folder ID: 1hWmSmcjZIUDHbkNmUZarTV3e  // ‚úÖ Now populated correctly
üìã Mentee Name: Nisha Binti Junus
‚úÖ Upload successful: [Google Drive URL]
```

## Key Learnings

### 1. Field Name Consistency is Critical
- Always verify field names match exactly across:
  - Google Sheets column headers
  - API response field names  
  - Form data structure field names
  - Apps Script expected field names

### 2. Architecture Consistency Pays Off
- Aligning Maju program with proven Bangkit/Sesi patterns reduced complexity
- Batch upload pattern is more reliable than individual uploads
- Code reuse from working implementations saves time

### 3. Systematic Debugging Approach
- Start with data flow tracing
- Add targeted console logging
- Verify each layer independently
- Check actual vs expected field names

## Files Modified

### Core Files
1. `pages/laporan-maju.js` - Field name changes, batch upload implementation
2. `pages/api/laporanMajuData.js` - Header search fix, response field name fix
3. `pages/api/upload-proxy.js` - Request cleaning preservation
4. `appsscript-2/Code.js` - Already had correct handleImageUpload function
5. `.env.local` - Updated MAJU_APPS_SCRIPT_URL

### Configuration Files
- Environment variables updated for new Apps Script deployment

## Success Criteria Met ‚úÖ
- [x] Images now upload successfully to Google Drive
- [x] Folder_ID correctly populated from mapping sheet
- [x] Apps Script receives all required fields
- [x] Batch upload pattern working consistently
- [x] Form submission completes without errors
- [x] Generated documents should now include uploaded images

## Future Maintenance Notes

### When Adding New Programs
1. Ensure consistent field naming across all layers
2. Use proven batch upload pattern from laporan-sesi
3. Verify mapping sheet column headers match API expectations
4. Test complete data flow from sheet ‚Üí API ‚Üí form ‚Üí Apps Script

### When Debugging Similar Issues
1. Check console for Folder_ID presence first
2. Verify mapping sheet structure matches code expectations
3. Trace data flow through each layer
4. Use targeted debugging rather than broad changes

## Technical Debt Resolved
- ‚úÖ Removed inconsistent field naming
- ‚úÖ Aligned with proven architecture patterns
- ‚úÖ Eliminated custom upload implementations in favor of tested batch approach
- ‚úÖ Improved error handling and debugging capabilities

**Resolution Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**  
**Impact**: Critical functionality restored for iTEKAD Maju program  
**Risk Level**: Low (using proven patterns from working implementations)
