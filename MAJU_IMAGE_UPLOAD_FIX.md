# Maju Program Image Upload Fix - Implementation Summary

## Issue Resolution Overview

The image upload functionality for the iTEKAD Maju program has been fixed by implementing a complete `handleImageUpload` function in the Maju Apps Script (`appsscript-2`).

## Problem Analysis

### Root Cause
The Maju Apps Script (`appsscript-2/Code.js`) was missing the `uploadImage` handler that exists in the Bangkit Apps Script (`appsscript-1/Code.js`). This caused:
- Image uploads to fail silently with "Unknown action" errors
- Document generation to succeed but without embedded images
- Users seeing "entry went ok inside sheet, document created but there is few error: no image inside sheet and document generated"

### Previous Hotfix
A temporary routing fix was implemented that sent Maju images to the Bangkit Apps Script endpoint, but this was architecturally incorrect and caused integration issues.

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Enhanced doPost Function in appsscript-2/Code.js

```javascript
function doPost(e) {
  const executionId = Utilities.getUuid();
  let logData = {
    executionId: executionId,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    action: null,
    success: false,
    errorMessage: null,
    processingTime: null
  };

  const startTime = new Date().getTime();

  try {
    const data = JSON.parse(e.postData.contents);
    logData.action = data.action;

    if (data.action === 'processRow') {
      return handleRowProcessing(data, executionId);
    } else if (data.action === 'uploadImage') {
      return handleImageUpload(data, executionId);
    } else {
      throw new Error(`Unknown action: ${data.action}`);
    }

  } catch (error) {
    // Error handling...
  }
}
```

### 2. New handleImageUpload Function

The new function provides:
- **Base64 to Blob conversion** for image processing
- **Smart file naming** with Maju-specific prefixes (`Maju_Sesi1_`, `MIA_Proof_`)
- **Google Drive integration** for secure file storage
- **Comprehensive error handling** with detailed logging
- **JSON response format** matching the Bangkit implementation

Key features:
- Handles both session images and MIA proof uploads
- Creates safe file names using mentee names and session numbers
- Uploads to mentee-specific Google Drive folders
- Returns file URLs and IDs for document embedding

### 3. Restored Proper Routing in laporan-maju.js

Image uploads now correctly route to `reportType: 'maju'` instead of the temporary `'sesi'` hotfix:

```javascript
// Session images
reportType: 'maju', // Proper Maju routing - now has uploadImage handler

// MIA proof images  
reportType: 'maju', // Proper Maju routing - now has uploadImage handler
```

## Deployment Requirements

### Apps Script Deployment
1. **Open Google Apps Script console**
2. **Navigate to appsscript-2 project**
3. **Deploy the updated Code.js**
4. **Test the uploadImage endpoint**

### Environment Variables
Ensure these are configured in the Apps Script:
- `SHEET_ID_MAJU`: Target spreadsheet for Maju data
- `TEMPLATE_DOC_ID_MAJU`: Document template for Maju reports
- Drive API permissions for folder access

## Testing Protocol

### Local Testing Checklist
1. **Start development server**: `npm run dev`
2. **Navigate to Maju form**: `/laporan-maju`
3. **Test image upload workflow**:
   - Upload session images (should show in folder with `Maju_Sesi1_` prefix)
   - Upload MIA proof (should show with `MIA_Proof_` prefix)
   - Verify images appear in generated document

### Validation Points
- ✅ Form submission completes without errors
- ✅ Images upload to correct Google Drive folder
- ✅ File names follow Maju naming convention
- ✅ Images embed correctly in generated document
- ✅ Spreadsheet receives complete data entry

## Architecture Benefits

### Proper Separation of Concerns
- **Bangkit Apps Script**: Handles V8 spreadsheet and Bangkit-specific document generation
- **Maju Apps Script**: Handles LaporanMaju spreadsheet and Maju-specific document generation
- **Clear routing**: Each program uses its dedicated backend

### Maintainability Improvements
- **Consistent API**: Both Apps Scripts now have identical uploadImage interfaces
- **Independent deployment**: Changes to one program don't affect the other
- **Proper error handling**: Maju-specific error messages and logging

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy Apps Script update** to production
2. **Run end-to-end test** with real Maju form submission
3. **Verify document generation** includes uploaded images
4. **Monitor execution logs** for any integration issues

## Files Modified

- `appsscript-2/Code.js`: Added handleImageUpload function and enhanced doPost routing
- `pages/laporan-maju.js`: Restored proper Maju routing for image uploads
- `MAJU_IMAGE_UPLOAD_FIX.md`: This documentation file

The image upload functionality for Maju program is now architecturally correct and should work seamlessly with the existing document generation workflow.
