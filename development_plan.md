## üìã Priority Tasks

### üî• **CRITICAL PRIORITY** - Fix User Issues

#### 1. Debug Dashboard Update Issue
**Problem:** Users report submitting reports but dashboard doesn't reflect updates (VERIFIED: Submissions reach Google Sheets but dashboard doesn't update)
**Timeline:** 1-2 days

**Phase A: Investigate Current Behavior (Do First)**
- [ ] Test current `/pages/api/mentor-stats.js` endpoint behavior
  - Add console.log statements to track when API is called
  - Log response data and timing
  - Verify if it hits Google Sheets API every time
- [ ] Test homepage data fetching in `/pages/index.js`
  - Add console.log to useEffect that fetches stats
  - Check if API call happens on every page load
  - Identify any browser caching behavior
- [ ] Create test scenario to reproduce issue
  - Log in as mentor and note current stats
  - Submit test report
  - Immediately check what `/api/mentor-stats` returns vs dashboard display
- [ ] Check Google Sheets API timing
  - Test delay between data write and read availability
  - Test consistency of multiple rapid API calls

**Phase B: Implement Fix Based on Findings**
- [ ] Create debug component for homepage with real-time API testing
- [ ] Add `/api/debug/recent-submissions` endpoint to verify submissions
- [ ] Implement comprehensive error logging throughout API calls
- [ ] Add manual refresh functionality for troubleshooting
- [ ] Include timestamp displays showing when data was last fetched

**Files to Modify:**
- `pages/api/mentor-stats.js` - Add debugging/logging
- `pages/index.js` - Add debugging and debug panel integration
- `pages/api/debug/recent-submissions.js` - New endpoint
- `components/DebugPanel.js` - New component

**Success Criteria:**
- Root cause of dashboard update issue identified
- Mentors can verify their submissions are reaching the database
- Clear error messages when API calls fail
- Ability to manually refresh data for immediate feedback

#### 4. Standardize Error Handling
**Problem:** Inconsistent error handling patterns across the application
**Timeline:** 2-3 days

- [ ] Add retry logic for failed API calls with exponential backoff
- [ ] Create user-friendly error messages with actionable suggestions
- [ ] Implement error boundary components for React error catching
- [ ] Add comprehensive logging for debugging

**Files to Create/Modify:**
- `lib/error-handler.js` - Centralized error utilities
- `components/ErrorBoundary.js` - React error boundary
- All API routes in `pages/api/` - Standardize error responses
- `lib/api-client.js` - Centralized API calling with retry logic

**Success Criteria:**
- Consistent error experience across all features
- Users receive helpful error messages with next steps
- Failed operations automatically retry when appropriate
- Comprehensive error logging for debugging

### üü¢ **MEDIUM PRIORITY** - Enhancements

#### 5. Performance Monitoring & Analytics

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Implement client-side performance tracking
- [ ] Add API response time monitoring
