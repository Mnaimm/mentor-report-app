# Laporan Sesi Timeout Fix - Implementation Summary
**Date:** October 25, 2025
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED - Ready for Testing

---

## 🎯 WHAT WAS FIXED

### **Problem 1: 504 Timeout Errors**
- **Root cause:** Apps Script call had NO timeout, causing function to exceed Vercel's 10-second limit
- **Fix:** Added 5-second timeout to Apps Script call using `Promise.race()`
- **Result:** Total function time now ~7s (2s Sheets API + 5s Apps Script max) - safely under 10s limit

### **Problem 2: "Unexpected token" JSON Parsing Errors**
- **Root cause:** When Vercel timed out, it returned HTML error page instead of JSON
- **Fix:** Added safe JSON parsing with content-type checking and fallback to text
- **Result:** Graceful error messages in Malay instead of cryptic "Unexpected token 'A'" errors

### **Problem 3: Duplicate Submissions**
- **Root cause:** Button not disabled fast enough, users could double-click
- **Fix:** Set `isSubmitting=true` IMMEDIATELY at start of handleSubmit, before validation
- **Result:** Button disabled on first click, preventing multiple submissions

### **Problem 4: Poor User Feedback**
- **Root cause:** No visibility into submission progress stages
- **Fix:** Added `submissionStage` state tracking with UI indicators
- **Result:** Users now see clear progress messages at each stage

## 📝 FILES MODIFIED

### **1. pages/api/submitReport.js**
**Lines modified:** 172-194

**Changes:**
```javascript
// BEFORE: No timeout
await fetch(appsScriptUrl, { ... });

// AFTER: 5-second timeout
const appsScriptTimeout = new Promise((_, reject) =>
  setTimeout(() => reject(new Error('Apps Script timeout after 5 seconds')), 5000)
);
const appsScriptCall = fetch(appsScriptUrl, { ... });
await Promise.race([appsScriptCall, appsScriptTimeout]);
```

### **2. pages/laporan-sesi.js**
**Multiple changes:**

#### **A. Added submission stage state** (line 173)
```javascript
const [submissionStage, setSubmissionStage] = useState({ stage: '', message: '', detail: '' });
```

#### **B. Prevent double-click** (lines 392-460)
```javascript
// BEFORE: setIsSubmitting(true) was after validation

// AFTER: Set immediately at start
if (isSubmitting) {
  console.warn('⚠️ Submission already in progress, ignoring duplicate click');
  return;
}
setIsSubmitting(true);

// Re-enable if validation fails
if (!selectedMentee) {
  setError('...');
  setIsSubmitting(false); // ← Added to all validation errors
  return;
}
```

#### **C. Safe JSON parsing** (lines 682-724)
```javascript
// Check content-type before parsing
const contentType = response.headers.get('content-type');

try {
  if (contentType && contentType.includes('application/json')) {
    result = await response.json();
  } else {
    // HTML error page - don't try to parse as JSON
    const text = await response.text();
    result = { error: '...helpful message...', retryable: false };
  }
} catch (parseError) {
  result = { error: 'Unable to read server response...', retryable: false };
}

// Enhanced error messages based on HTTP status
if (response.status === 504) {
  userMessage = `⏱️ Server timeout - images uploaded, check Google Sheet...`;
}
```

#### **D. Submission progress tracking** (lines 462, 688-692, 718-723, 792-824)
```javascript
// Stage 1: Preparing
setSubmissionStage({ stage: 'preparing', message: 'Preparing submission...', detail: '' });

// Stage 2: Uploading
setSubmissionStage({
  stage: 'uploading',
  message: 'Uploading images to Google Drive...',
  detail: `Uploading ${uploadPromises.length} images`
});

// Stage 3: Saving
setSubmissionStage({
  stage: 'saving',
  message: 'Saving report to Google Sheets...',
  detail: 'This may take up to 30 seconds'
});

// Stage 4: Complete
setSubmissionStage({
  stage: 'complete',
  message: 'Report submitted successfully!',
  detail: ''
});

// Error handling with stage-specific messages
if (submissionStage.stage === 'uploading') {
  errorMessage = `❌ Image upload failed: ${err.message}`;
  errorDetail = 'Check your internet connection and try again.';
}
```

#### **E. Progress UI component** (lines 1197-1227)
```javascript
{/* Submission Stage Progress Indicator */}
{submissionStage.stage && submissionStage.stage !== 'complete' && !compressionProgress.show && (
  <div className={`border rounded-lg p-4 mb-4 ${
    submissionStage.stage === 'error' ? 'bg-red-50 border-red-200' : 'bg-blue-50 border-blue-200'
  }`}>
    <div className="flex items-center space-x-3">
      {submissionStage.stage !== 'error' && (
        <div className="animate-spin rounded-full h-6 w-6 border-b-2 border-blue-600"></div>
      )}
      {submissionStage.stage === 'error' && (
        <div className="text-red-600 text-2xl">⚠️</div>
      )}
      <div className="flex-1">
        <p className="text-sm font-medium">
          {submissionStage.message}
        </p>
        {submissionStage.detail && (
          <p className="text-xs mt-1">
            {submissionStage.detail}
          </p>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
)}
```

## 🎨 USER EXPERIENCE IMPROVEMENTS

### **Before Fix:**
```
User clicks submit
↓
[Shows "📤 Uploading to server..." for 8+ seconds]
↓
ERROR: Unexpected token 'A', 'An error o'... is not valid JSON
↓
User confused, clicks submit again
↓
Creates duplicate rows in Google Sheet
```

### **After Fix:**
```
User clicks submit
↓
Button disabled immediately (prevents double-click)
↓
Shows "Preparing submission..."
↓
Shows "📸 Compressing: image.jpg (Step 3/4)..." with progress bar
↓
Shows "Uploading images to Google Drive... (Uploading 6 images)"
↓
Shows "Saving report to Google Sheets... (This may take up to 30 seconds)"
↓
Either:
  ✅ SUCCESS: "Report submitted successfully!" → Form resets
  OR
  ⚠️ ERROR: Clear message with guidance:
     "⏱️ Server timeout - images uploaded, but couldn't confirm if saved.
      ✓ Check Google Sheet to see if report appears
      ✗ DO NOT submit again without checking
      📞 Contact admin if report is missing"
```

    - OR "⚠️ Automation ping failed: Apps Script timeout" (if slow, but submission still succeeds)
- ✅ Total function execution time < 10 seconds

**Pass Criteria:** Function completes within 10s, no Vercel timeouts

---

### **Test 6: Progress Messages Clarity (User Testing)**
**Purpose:** Verify users understand what's happening

**How to test:**
1. Ask a non-technical user (mentor) to submit a report
2. Watch their reaction to progress messages
3. Ask questions:
   - "Do you know what's happening right now?"
   - "How long do you expect this to take?"
   - "If you see an error, do you know what to do?"

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ User feels confident throughout process
- ✅ User understands each stage
- ✅ User knows whether to retry if error occurs

**Pass Criteria:** User doesn't ask "Is it working?" or "Should I click again?"

## 📞 SUPPORT

### **If Issues Occur:**

**Issue: Still getting 504 timeouts**
- Check Vercel logs to see which operation is slow (Sheets API or Apps Script)
- May need to reduce Apps Script timeout to 3-4 seconds
- Consider moving document generation to background job

**Issue: Users see duplicate rows**
- Check if double-click prevention is working (Test 2)
- May need to implement idempotency protection
- Verify `isSubmitting` state is set correctly

**Issue: Progress messages not showing**
- Check `submissionStage` state in React DevTools
- Verify UI component is rendering correctly
- Check browser console for React errors

**Issue: JSON parsing errors still occurring**
- Check response content-type in Network tab
- Verify error handling logic is correct
- Check Vercel logs for actual response content
