# Project Standards
- **Ground Truth:** Source code is the truth; ignore outdated PRDs.
- **DRY Principle:** Compare `laporan-bangkit.js` and `laporan-maju-um.js`. Extract shared 'Upward Mobility' logic to `UpwardMobilityUtils.js`.
- **Data Sync:** Every write must be a non-blocking dual-write (Sheets + Supabase). Use `upsert` for Supabase.
- **Auth:** Authorization must be derived from 'Mentor Mapping' (NextAuth + Role check).
- **Verification:** Any change MUST be tested by the Browser Agent (UI clicks + Auth checks).
