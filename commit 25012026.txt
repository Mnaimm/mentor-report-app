✅ Removed:

UM sheet loading (50 lines)

✅ Removed:

UM from urgency scoring (line 89)
UM Pending stat card from summary panel
"UM Forms Pending" from status breakdown
✅ Preserved:

All session display logic

✅ Removed:

UM from card priority calculation
UM pending status style (purple badge)
UM Status Section display (green/purple box)
"Submit UM Form" button
handleSubmitUM() function
✅ Preserved:

All status badges (overdue, due soon, on track, MIA)
Session progress display ("This Round" + "All Sessions")
"Submit Session Report" button
View Details and Email buttons
Result: Cards show ONLY session-related information, no UM badges or buttons

Verification:
✅ No syntax errors in any file
✅ Session counting unchanged
✅ Round determination unchanged
✅ MIA behavior unchanged
✅ No new Supabase reads introduced
✅ Admin pages (index.js, mentor-stats) untouched

What Mentors Now See:
Dashboard Stats:

Total Mentees

Need Action (overdue + due soon only)
Mentee Cards Show:

Status badge (overdue, due soon, on track, MIA)
Current round progress (e.g., "1/1" or "0/1")
All sessions count (e.g., "3/5")
Last session date
Due date with days remaining
Completely Removed:

All UM form references
Purple "UM Pending" badges
UM submission tracking

 improve submit button logic and program label reliability

Changes:
- Change Submit Session Report button visibility to round-based logic
  (show if reportsThisRound < expectedReportsThisRound)
- Fix program badge to use mentee.program directly from API instead of 
  deriving from batch name (more reliable)

Impact:
- Button now shows for mentees who completed past sessions but not current round
- Example: Shah Kirin (Batch 4) has Session 1, needs Session 2 - button now appears
- Program labels (Bangkit/Maju) now display correctly even if batch naming is inconsistent

Behavior preserved:
- Status calculation unchanged
- Progress counting unchanged  
- Badge colors unchanged (blue=Bangkit, green=Maju)
- All other logic unchanged"
